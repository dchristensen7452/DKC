        <body>This week we are learning how to setup and run a website from scratch. No safety net, no WordPress, no Divi Builder. Just a text editor.
            Since I am the only one in the class who seems to use a PC rather than a Mac, I will outline the steps needed to setup a PC to host a local server. Actually, it’s pretty simple to do.
            Step One: Enable Internet Information Services
            Go to Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features on or off
            Ensure that Internet Information Services is selected
            Note: FTP Server does not need to be selected
            Ensure that Internet Information Services Hostable Web Core is selected
            Step Two: Enable WWW Publishing Service
            Go to Computer Management -> Services and Applications
            Select World Wide Web Publishing Services
            Right Click -> Properties -> Startup Type “Automatic”
            Right Click -> Start
            Step Three: Setup Index in wwwroot folder
            Go to OS(C: drive) -> inetpub -> wwwroot
            Note: There should be two files already there, automatically generated by Microsoft
            Paste or Save HTML files to this root folder
            Step Four: Open Root Files using Localhost
            Open an internet browser
            In the address bar type “localhost” –> hit enter
            The browser should display the HTML file labeled “index” (or the first HTML file it comes across)
            Congratulations! You are up a running localhost.
