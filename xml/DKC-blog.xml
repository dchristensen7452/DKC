            <p>This week we are learning how to setup and run a website from scratch. 
                No safety net, no WordPress, no Divi Builder. Just a text editor.
                Since I am the only one in the class who seems to use a PC rather than a Mac, 
                I will outline the steps needed to setup a PC to host a local server. Actually, it’s pretty simple to do.</p>
            
            <p><b>Step One</b>: Enable Internet Information Services
                Go to Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features on or off
                Ensure that Internet Information Services is selected
                Note: FTP Server does not need to be selected.
                Ensure that Internet Information Services Hostable Web Core is selected.</p>
            
            <p><b>Step Two</b>: Enable WWW Publishing Service
                Go to Computer Management -> Services and Applications
                Select World Wide Web Publishing Services
                Right Click -> Properties -> Startup Type “Automatic”
                Right Click -> Start</p>
            
            <p><b>Step Three</b>: Setup Index in wwwroot folder
                Go to OS(C: drive) -> inetpub -> wwwroot
                Note: There should be two files already there, automatically generated by Microsoft
                Paste or Save HTML files to this root folder</p>
            
            <p><b>Step Four</b>: Open Root Files using Localhost
                Open an internet browser
                In the address bar type “localhost” –> hit enter.
                The browser should display the HTML file labeled “index” (or the first HTML file it comes across)</p>
            
            <p>Congratulations! You are up and running localhost.</p>
