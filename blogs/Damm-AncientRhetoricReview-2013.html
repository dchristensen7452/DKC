                           version of his dissertation under the supervision of John Kloppenborg, Alex
                           Damm uses the conventions of ancient rhetoric to evaluate the plausibility of source
                           critical theories regarding the Synoptic Problem. Damm’s work opens up questions
                           for discussion of why the Synoptic authors changed their source material the
                           way they did (a question posed by scholars such as Watson, <i>Gospel Writing</i>,
                           169; Burridge, “The Gospels and Acts,” in <i>Handbook of Classical Rhetoric</i>,
                           ed. Porter, 512; Goodacre, <i>The Synoptic Problem</i>, 30) and what are the
                           more likely sources they used. In particular, Damm sets out to “demonstrate the
                           rhetorically problematic nature of hypotheses of Markan conflation and the
                           relative plausibility of hypotheses of Markan priority” (xv). This work will
                           thus be useful for anyone studying the merits of source critical theories, but
                           it will also benefit those who are interested in the process of rhetorical
                           composition in early Christian texts more generally. </p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Damm goes about his
                           task systematically. In Part I (3–170), “The Rhetorical Adaptation of Chreia,”
                           Damm evaluates the theoretical systems for rhetorical adaptation laid out in
                           the rhetorical handbooks (Chap. 1, 3–80), heavily relying upon the handbooks of
                           Theon (20–31) and Hermogenes (32–38). However, one should note that Damm’s
                           treatment of the rhetorical handbooks is somewhat derivative and he seems to
                           engage more closely with Kennedy’s translation of Aelius Theon than with the
                           Greek text itself. Damm then corroborates the <i>progymnasmata</i> with examples
                           of adaption from two ancient authors, Plutarch (Chap. 2, 81–110) and Josephus
                           (Chap. 3, 111–166). Regarding Plutarch, Damm examines parallel <span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span
                              lang=EL>α</span> between the <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποφθε</span>́<span
                                 lang=EL>γματα</span><span lang=EL> </span>(<i>apophthegms</i>) and the <span
                                    lang=EL>βι</span>́<span lang=EL>οι</span> (<i>lives</i>) (e.g. <i>Reg. imp.
                                       apophth</i>. III: 181D (29); <i>Alex</i>. 47.5 [pp. 91–96]) using conventions
                           of rhetorical arrangement (A.3 below). As for Josephus, Damm compares several
                           of the speeches in the <i>Jewish Antiquities</i> with their corresponding
                           sources from the LXX by looking at their rhetorical effectiveness and
                           apologetic-theological interests (reason B below) (e.g. 1 Chr 22:7-16 [LXX]; <i>Ant</i>.
                           7.337–340 [pp. 145–155]).</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>From his survey
                           of ancient rhetorical handbooks and direct engagement with Plutarch and
                           Josephus, Damm formulates what he calls “a spectrum of rhetorical reasons for
                           adapting chreia” (169). Reason A is “to draw chreia into closer conformity with
                           rhetorical principles” (168); this includes four subheadings: (A.1) to
                           intensifying proofs for biographical, apologetic, or theological reasons; (A.2)
                           to reformulate the source in accordance with stasis theory; (A.3) to conform
                           the source to a rhetorical arrangement theory, viz., introduction, statement of
                           facts, proposition, proofs, conclusion (cf. Aristotle, <i>Rhet</i>. 3.13.1 – 5;
                           [Cicero], <i>Rhet. Ad Her.</i> 3.9.16 – 17), (A.4) “to rearrange the proofs
                           more effectively” (169). Reason B is “to address biographical, historical and
                           theological interests” (169). Reason C is “to draw a chreia into closer accord
                           with the fundamental rhetorical principle of clarity (<span lang=EL>σαφη</span>́<span
                              lang=EL>νεια</span>/<i>perspecuitas</i>)” (169). Reason D is “to draw a chreia
                           into closer accord with the fundamental rhetorical principle of propriety (<span
                              lang=EL>το</span>̀ <span lang=EL>πρε</span>́<span lang=EL>πον</span>/<i>aptum</i>)”
                           (169); this includes two subheadings: (D.1) making changes appropriate to the
                           part of speech, e.g., incorporating <span lang=EL>η</span>̔͂<span lang=EL>θος</span>
                           into the introduction; (D.2) using material to support the <i>propositio</i>. </p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Damm goes on in
                           Part II (173–280), “Applications of Rhetoric to the Synoptic Problem,” to use
                           these reasons for adaptation to evaluate three major source critical theories
                           on the Synoptic Gospels’ literary relationship, viz., the Neo-Griesbach
                           Hypothesis (2GH), the Farrer Hypothesis (FH), and the Two-Document Hypothesis
                           (2DH). Here Damm looks at two pericopae: The Question on Fasting (Mt 9:14–17;
                           Mk 2:18–22; Lk 5:33–39 [Chap. 4, 173–220]) and the Beelzebul Controversy (Mt
                           12:22–37; Mk 3:20–35; Lk 11:14–36 [Chap. 5, 221–280]). In his analysis of the
                           pericopae Damm is also systematic. He begins by describing the pericopae as
                           they appear in each Synoptic Gospel, as well as in the document Q, and then draws
                           conclusions on the purpose and meaning of the episode in its different Gospel
                           contexts. Damm then evaluates the plausibility of each Synoptic source theory
                           on the merits of his spectrum of adaptation.</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Damm reaches two
                           conclusions at the end of his monograph, one which corresponds to his thesis
                           statement, and one which is auxiliary but was begged throughout his assessment
                           (xv, cf. 281). Regarding the former, Damm states that the evidence examined
                           between the two pericopae “renders hypotheses of Markan priority more
                           rhetorically plausible than hypotheses of Matthean priority” (281). As for the
                           latter, Damm concludes that the examination of these <span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span
                              lang=EL>α</span><span lang=EL> </span>“has not indicated whether Luke more
                           plausibly adapts Matthew (the 2GH and FH) or the sayings gospel Q (the 2DH)” (281).</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Damm’s methodology,
                           that one can use rhetorical criticism to make source critical evaluations of
                           the Synoptics texts by tracing the development of stylistic virtues (<span
                              lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρεται</span>́), especially through clarity (<span
                                 lang=EL>σαφη</span>́<span lang=EL>νεια</span>/<i>perspecuitas</i>), propriety (<span
                                    lang=EL>το</span>̀ <span lang=EL>πρε</span>́<span lang=EL>πον</span>/<i>aptum</i>),
                           and overall improvement through <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ξεργασι</span>́<span
                              lang=EL>α</span> (55–58; Theon, <i>Progymnasmata</i> (ed. Spengel 2.62–64;
                           Kennedy, <i>Progymnasmata</i>, 6–8), is dependent on his definition of rhetoric.
                           In defining rhetoric, Damm heavily relies on Quintilian’s definition, “the
                           science of speaking well (<i>bene dicendi Scientia</i>)” (xvi, 5; Quintilian, <i>Inst</i>.
                           2.15.38 [Damm incorrectly cites 1.Pr.9 on page xvi, and 2.15.38 is not listed
                           in the index]). Damm provides very little resistance to this definition. In
                           fact, he only cites Aristotle’s definition of rhetoric once, in a footnote (5;
                           Aristotle, <i>Rhet</i>. 1.2.2). By doing so, Damm does not sufficiently engage
                           with how various definitions provide different emphases for rhetorical
                           composition; as Kennedy points out, Aristotle’s definition emphasizes proof,
                           while Quintilian’s emphasis is “on a variety of rhetorical features which does
                           not neglect proof, but gives increase attention to style” (Kennedy, <i>New
                              Testament Interpretation through Rhetorical Criticism</i>, 13). It is by using
                           Quintilian’s definition that Damm is able to justify the use of rhetoric as a
                           means for source critical judgements. Aristotle’s definition, on the other
                           hand, makes Damm’s methodology more tenuous. If one sees rhetoric as “the power
                           to discover the possible means of persuasion about each subject” (ἔστω δὴ ἡ ῥητορικὴ
                           δύναμις περὶ ἕκαστον τοῦ θεωρῆσαι τὸ ἐνδεχόμενον πιθανόν [Aristotle, <i>Rhet</i>.
                           1.2.1]), then a comparison between texts like the Synoptic Gospels cannot
                           postulate “improvements” among the texts <i>per se</i>, but is more suited to
                           describe how each Gospel makes a meaningful argument/story based on the
                           concerns each audience had on hand. Comparative rhetoric thus does not have to
                           imply source criticism. This is an avenue that I hope Damm’s study might open
                           for further exploration, viz., how rhetoric might also aid the scholarly
                           understanding of each Gospel’s <i>Sitz im Leben</i>.</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>The use of
                           ancient rhetoric to determine the plausibility of source critical theories and
                           the originality of forms, such as <span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>,
                           has been met with criticism before. In this regard, Damm is engaged with providing
                           a response to E. P. Sanders’ and Margaret Davies’ assessment of form critics (e.g.
                           Gerhardsson, <i>Memory and Manuscript</i> [1961]) who sought to determine the original
                           version of a sayings tradition, they write “the synoptics conform to no model which
                           will tell us <i>how much</i> the material changed, nor <i>what directions</i>
                           the changes took” (<i>Studying the Synoptic Gospels</i>, 131). Damm’s response,
                           to me at least, seems to side-step the issue (59–60). While Damm makes the
                           assertion that “several rhetorical principles are basic enough to composition
                           that we can expect their application to be valid much of the time,” (60) the
                           statement as Damm formulates it makes his previous description of rhetorical
                           conventions as “standards against which to measure more plausible kinds of
                           literary dependence” to be more like shifting guidelines rather than a stable
                           set of principles (xxxv). In a similar way, he also avoids a substantive
                           definition of what constitutes a principle for change when pointing out that
                           rhetorical techniques were meant for original compositions and not necessarily for
                           rules governing adaptation and change (38).</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Damm should be
                           applauded for his systematic attention to detail when examining Synoptic
                           pericopae. For example, his description of the chiasmus in Mark 3:20–35 (pp.
                           222–225) was particularly helpful for my reading of the text and subsequent study
                           into Matthew’s and Luke’s changes. I found the discussion of Matthew 12:24–32 drawing
                           Mark 3: 22b–30 into closer conformity with <i>stasis</i> theory especially
                           enlightening as it neatly highlights and justifies Matthew’s arrangement of <i>ethos</i>,
                           <i>pathos</i>, and <i>logos</i> in the pericope (248–252). Additionally, although
                           Damm favors the 2DH, which is subtly revealed at one point in a quip on page
                           265, “There is, to be sure, something odd in the fact that Luke must retain
                           Matthew’s parts and sequence of speech while systematically changing their
                           contents; but it is possible,” his commitment to his methodology brings him to
                           a relatively balanced defense of his thesis without dismissing the FH
                           (281–282).</p>
                        
                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>Still, one
                           cannot help but feel that this study is geared toward a more robust
                           confrontation between the 2DH and FH in the future, one which favors the 2DH. Damm
                           moves toward the supposition that there is a best practice for rhetorical
                           composition through use of “plausibility” language (xxxv, 8, 60, 281), language
                           that is championed by his supervisor in defense of the 2DH (Kloppenborg, <i>Excavating
                              Q</i>, 43). Such a claim would greatly benefit the 2DH and scholars who make
                           the supposition that, for example, the Matthean Sermon on the Mount is the more
                           plausible form of a particular set of Jesus’ sayings in comparison with Luke
                           (e.g. Fuller, <i>The New Testament in Current Study</i>, 87; cf. Goodacre, <i>Case
                              Against Q</i>, 81–104). Additionally, Damm makes little effort to establish the
                           existence of the Q document before subjecting it to his rhetorical analysis of
                           change on the part of Matthew and Luke. (There is some discussion in note 51 on
                           page 230.) There is thus an underlying assumption throughout the book that Q is
                           a stable document and can be compared against Matthew and Luke. However, Q is
                           not stable, it is constructed (Kloppenborg, <i>Excavating Q</i>, 87; Goodacre, <i>Case
                              Against Q</i>, 15). Damm even says so himself when concluding that Luke does
                           not “weaken Q’s treatment of stasis or arrangement or proofs” in the Beelzebul
                           Controversy (279); he writes, “This conclusion might sound disingenuous given
                           that Q exists in Luke by definition, but it remains to Luke’s credit from the
                           perspective of the 2DH that he incorporates all of Q” (279). Granted, Damm’s
                           procedure is to evaluate source critical theories and not prove the existence
                           of Q, but without substantial discussion on the nature of Q as a hypothetical
                           document Damm’s assessment here must remain disingenuous. How can one compare
                           the “improvement” of Q when that document itself was constructed from the texts
                           that supposedly used it? Such a comparison does not demonstrate Luke’s or
                           Matthew’s use of an ancient sayings source, rather it is a self-congratulatory
                           statement that modern scholars have “reconstructed” Q properly to fit the texts.

                        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'>In all, Damm presents
                           a study that is meticulously organized and insightful for source critics and
                           New Testament scholars at large. He carefully triangulates the application of
                           rhetorical theory on the Synoptic Problem by engaging with rhetorical handbooks,
                           non-Christian sources, and the Christian sources under examination. The
                           rhetorical principles he discusses may not be able to offer a maximal solution
                           to the Synoptic Problem (281) but they are nonetheless useful for further study
                           as they open up questions about the evangelist’s motivations for writing and
                           the means by which they instructed their audiences.</p>
